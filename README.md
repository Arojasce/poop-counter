Hello all,

This is my first Script in GitHub, it is a simply ðŸ’© emote counter from a .txt imported from a Whatsapp conversation.


--> Why did I do that?
My friends and I have a Whatsapp group where we write ðŸ’© when someone finish a poop. So we have a great shit data base and we need analysis that data.

--> What do the script do?
