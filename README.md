Hello all,

This is my first Script in GitHub, it is a simply ðŸ’© emote counter from a .txt imported from a Whatsapp conversation.




# Why did I do that?

My friends and I have a Whatsapp group where we write ðŸ’© when someone finish a poop. So we have a great shit data base and we need analysis that data.

# What do the script do?


The script read (and structure in .xlsx) a .txt, that need to be in the same directory as the .py
